Analysis for Air Quality changes in Cambridge


This contains all my analysis on the changes in air quality in Cambridge. I have been using this as an exercise to learn how to link my GitHub account and RStudio and had a couple of hickups along the way so apologies that this is not professional. 

The one thing I want to highlight is that to plot the maps in the analysis you will need a Google API Key -- which may require a credit card. I had inadvertedly included my API key in the first upload but have since deleted that key! So don't bother trying to use it!

Any comments on this please do let me know.
